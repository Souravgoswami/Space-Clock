# Space::Clock
Yet another beautiful and configurable digital clock application written in ruby.

## Running the clock:
  1. You need Ruby, and Ruby2D.
         
        You can download and install Ruby from here (documentation provided on the website):
              https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads
         
        You can get Ruby2D from here:
              http://www.ruby2d.com/learn/get-started
             
  2. After successful installation, go to the Space::Clock directory/folder, and run the main.rb file with ruby.
  3. You can run it directly by clicking on it twice, like other applications - for that you first need to make it executable:
  
          chmod 777 main.rb

## Keys:

+  **Space**
  
   Press the Space key to show / hide the foreground.

+  **Up**

   The Up key will increase the opacity of the foreground.

+  **Down**

   Pressing the Down key will reduce the opacity of the foreground.

+  **Right / Left**

   Make the particles on cursor disappear!

+  **Right Shift / Left Shift**

   The Right Shift and Left Shift keys will launch a new window of Space::Clock parallely.

+  **Left Alt / Right Alt / Left Ctrl / Tab**

   Shuffle everything in the Space.

+  **F11**

   Toggle fullscreen.

+ **A / I**

   Launch the about window.

+  **C / S**

   Show the options mentioned in the config.conf file

## Mouse Buttons:

+  **Secondary Mouse Button**
  
   Pressing the Secondary mouse button will show a greetings.
   Pressing the Secondary mouse button on Time and Date will change the Time and Date format.
   Pressing the Secondary mouse button on a custom text will help you drag the text.
      
+  **Primary Mouse Button**

   Pressing the primary mouse button will change the foreground colour randomly (it generates a random hex colour)

## Configuration File:

   The configuration file is located in the same directory of main.rb. It's called config.conf. The # are comments.
   You can change the values after the `=` to change the behaviour of Space::Clock.

**Read the instructions.txt file for these info, and for more - which contains the keyboard shortcuts, and mouse functions.**

## Note

  Space::Clock has no physics. There's a lot of **violation of physics**, I have made it in a way so it looks beautiful...
