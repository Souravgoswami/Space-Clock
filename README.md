## Running the Source Code üç≠
  1. You need to [install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads) and [Ruby2D](http://www.ruby2d.com/learn/get-started)
             
  2. After successful installation, go to the Space::Clock directory and run the main.rb file with the Ruby interpreter.

   The configuration file is located in the same directory of main.rb. It's called config.conf. The # are comments.

## Note üóí

Space::Clock has no physics. There's a lot of **violation of physics**, I have made it in a way so it looks beautiful...
